				I must confess my journey with tea started from very humble beginnings , and may not be all that different for many of you .
				The warm black brew that had a dash of milk and spoon of sugar , sipped from the most delightful bone china cup decorated with 					                pretty violets on a creamy background at my nannas house on weekend sleepovers , offered not only a pleasant taste sensation but                 became a symbol of comfort , that still is a staple in my diet today.
				These days however in our global community we have opportunity to enjoy products from all over the world , and tea is one of those 	                products that benefits from global trade and so gives us in modern day access to varieties and tastes that our grandmothers would                 only have dreamed of .
                <br/>
				White, green, black and oolong teas plus various other styles of this ancient brew can now be enjoyed as an everyday indulgence of                flavour as well as offering to us the health benefits we believe it to posses.
                Some teas have little or no caffeine, some can be used to detox, some have high levels of antioxidants , and others can simply be               	drunk to give a lift to the energy levels required to get through a busy day , or calm and relax, as we wind down to go to sleep .
				<br />
				The history of this ancient drink is as fascinating as the variety of flavours you can enjoy from its brew.
				Start your journey with a visit to Teahouse , Lords Place Orange, N.S.W. where a selection of premium loose leaf teas are available                to try or take home. The quaint teahouse enviroment, tasty treats to eat and delightful collectibles will make your visit a                beginning to an investment of flavour and good health.
